# CS300

## What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
I developed a program that read in course information from a file and allowed the user to sort that information alphanumerically and display information about each individual course.

## How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
I created an object using a struct and created a vector of objects to store the information. It is important to understand data structures because that understanding allows us to better predict the efficiency of an application while we create it. For small data sets, the differences are more or less negligable on modern machines, but when working with large data sets, the difference in efficiency can be staggering. 

## How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
There major roadblock that I encountered when I was developing this application was reading the information into the program correctly. I had to slow down and ensure that I understood what each line of my code did before I could find the errors that I was encountering. I read the values into temporary variables, added the variables to a temporary struct, and added that struct to my vector of structs containing the information.

## How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
I have learned more about vectors and objects after completing this exercise and am significantly more comfortable using them.

## How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
This project taught me the importance of writing good pseudocode and really planning my projects before I begin coding. In the past, I had a habit of just "jumping right in" and that has contributed to me not finishing several projects because of a lack of direction. Also, it taught me the imortance of using data structures that are more flexible in terms of dynamic data sets. The program that I created can be used with a data set of any size, where in the past I most likely would have read the information into an array, forcing me to have a data set of a certain size or rewriting and compiling code after the data set has been modified.
